2. **Available Colors**: 8 colors to choose from
3. **Feedback After Each Guess**:
   - 🐂 **Bulls**: Correct color in correct position
   - 🐄 **Cows**: Correct color in wrong position

### Controls
- **Left Mouse Click**: Select colors for your guess
- **Right Mouse Click**: Submit your guess
- **Number of Guesses**: Choose difficulty (4-10 attempts)

### Winning
